Find-A-Mechanic

Project Overview
This project was developed by a team of four as part of the CSE 611 course at the University at Buffalo during the fall 2022 semester. The goal was to create an end-to-end garage management system that revolutionizes how small and large garages showcase their services and manage appointments with customers.

Features
Web Application: A comprehensive web platform for garages to manage appointments, chat with customers, oversee mechanics, and handle leaves.

Mobile App: An intuitive mobile application that allows customers to discover nearby garages based on ratings, schedule appointments, manage bookings, leave reviews, and communicate with garage owners.

Mechanic Interface: Special functionality for mechanics to access information about assigned tasks, update garage owners on any additional work required, and communicate efficiently with customers.

Your Contributions
As part of the development team, your primary focus was on enhancing the web application. Your key contributions include:

Invoice Generator: Developed a robust service for generating invoices seamlessly within the application.

Calendar Management: Implemented the core functionality of the calendar system, allowing for efficient appointment bookings and management.

Technology Stack: Leveraged a tech stack comprising PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. Utilized Git for version control and deployed the application on AWS for scalability and reliability.

Additional Work: Contributed to other modules, wrote comprehensive documentation, and resolved existing bugs to ensure a smooth user experience.
